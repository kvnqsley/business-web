        You need Broadband internet connection. The more call volume

        been plenty of bandwidth for us. Wired Ethernet router. You
        have a ton of options here but your budget will likely decide

      <h3>What is SIP Trunking?</h3>

      <p>
        It is quickly becoming a universal standard to adopt SIP
        (Session Initiation Protocol) for business communication
        purposes. This standard is used by SIP Trunking to enable
        businesses to make calls and receive calls through traditional
        telephone lines by means of VoIP (Voice Over Internet
        Protocol). This is done through data networks. In addition,
        SIP trunking enables you to combine both voice and data over a
        single network connection. This benefit will almost certainly
        save you a significant amount of money and time. We offer both
        managed and unmanaged IPVPN services, allowing you to make the
        most out of your existing network. We can also connect you to
        a wide range of other devices and PBX systems.

      <h3>What Is ADSL?</h3>

      <p>
        The acronym stands for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line. It
        is technology that allows you to connect to the internet by
        using existing telephone networks. It is connected at all
        times and it provides very fast access due to the fact that it
        is extremely efficient when converting data. It also use a
        much wider frequency range than ordinary modems.
